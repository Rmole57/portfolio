          I&apos;m a software engineer based in New York, NY. I have multiple
          years of experience using a variety of technologies across the
          development stack. As a firm believer in the notion that there is no
          &quot;one size fits all&quot; solution, I enjoy learning and working
          with new technologies to find the best fit for the task at hand.
